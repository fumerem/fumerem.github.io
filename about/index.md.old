​	Unlike the vast majority of people,I hate trends,especially pop music and stars that people rave about and promote.I'm more comfortable with the classics,they calm me down.**I don't have much to write about because not many people will pay attention to me.**

​	Furthermore,I sincerely thank the After-Dark and its creator,Josh Habdas,have been seemingly yeeted from the Internet,when I tried all the [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) themes but was not satisfied,~~wanted to develop my own theme but lacked energy and time~~,and had to choose [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) eventually.
